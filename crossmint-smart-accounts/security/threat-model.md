# Smart Account STRIDE Threat Model

## Description

### What is a Smart Account?

A **Smart Account** is an advanced account implementation built on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform that provides programmable authorization logic through a custom smart contract. Unlike traditional Stellar accounts that rely solely on Ed25519 signatures and basic multisig thresholds, smart accounts implement Soroban's `CustomAccountInterface` to enable sophisticated, policy-driven authorization rules.

This smart account is an **upgradeable smart contract** that implements both the `SmartAccountInterface` (for account management operations) and Soroban's `CustomAccountInterface` (for transaction authorization). It leverages Stellar's account abstraction framework to decouple authentication logic from application-specific authorization rules, allowing for much more granular control over who can authorize what types of transactions.

The key innovation is moving from Stellar's traditional "signature + threshold" model to a **role-based, policy-driven authorization system** where different signers can have different permission levels and constraints.

### Key Features

#### üîÑ **Fully Authorized Upgradeability**
- Smart contract code can be upgraded through the standard signer permission system
- Upgrades require proper authorization from signers with sufficient permissions
- No special backdoors or admin keys - upgrades follow the same authorization rules as other operations

#### üë• **Hierarchical Signer Types**

| Signer Type | Permissions & Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Admin Signers** | ‚Ä¢ Can authorize any transaction for the wallet<br>‚Ä¢ Full control over signer configuration (add, update, revoke signers)<br>‚Ä¢ Can authorize contract upgrades<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot be revoked (prevents account lockout) |
| **Standard Signers** | ‚Ä¢ Can authorize most transactions<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot modify signer configuration or upgrade the contract<br>‚Ä¢ Ideal for day-to-day operations while maintaining security boundaries<br>‚Ä¢ Optional policy-based restrictions for controlled access<br>‚Ä¢ Perfect for delegating permissions to AI agents, automated systems, or third-party services<br>‚Ä¢ Support for granular permissions such as:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Token spending limits<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contract interaction deny-listing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Time-based restrictions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Custom authorization policies<br>‚Ä¢ Extensible framework for adding new permission types |

#### üîê **Multi-Signature Algorithm Support**

| Signature Algorithm | Features & Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Ed25519 Signatures** | ‚Ä¢ Traditional cryptographic signatures<br>‚Ä¢ Backward compatible with existing Stellar tooling |
| **Secp256r1 Signatures** | ‚Ä¢ Enables **Passkey/WebAuthn** authentication flows<br>‚Ä¢ Provides better user experience through biometric authentication<br>‚Ä¢ Supports hardware security keys and platform authenticators<br>‚Ä¢ Eliminates the need for users to manage seed phrases |

This dual signature support allows the smart account to bridge traditional crypto workflows with modern web authentication standards, making it more accessible to mainstream users while maintaining the security guarantees expected in the Stellar ecosystem.

**Extensible Architecture**: The signer implementation follows a strategy pattern, making it easily extensible to support additional cryptographic algorithms. New signature schemes such as Secp256k1 or future cryptographic standards can be integrated without modifying the core authorization logic, ensuring the smart account remains adaptable to evolving security requirements.


### Smart Account Authentication Flow

#### Simplified Authorization Flow

The Smart Account implements a strict security model with the following core principles:

1. **Universal Authorization Requirement**: Every execution context (transaction operation) MUST be authorized by at least one signer with sufficient permissions
2. **Cryptographic Integrity**: All signatures provided MUST be cryptographically valid and verifiable
3. **Hierarchical Permission Model**: Authorization success depends on the signer's role and the operation being performed

**Step-by-Step Authorization Process:**

1. **Signature Validation Phase**
   - Verify all provided signatures are cryptographically correct (Ed25519 or Secp256r1)
   - Confirm all signing keys exist in the smart account's signer registry
   - Reject the entire transaction if any signature is invalid

2. **Authorization Check Phase**
   - For each execution context in the transaction:
     - Iterate through all verified signers until one with sufficient permissions is found
       - **Admin Signers**: Automatically authorized for all operations
       - **Standard Signers**: Authorized for non-admin operations only
       - **Standard Signers with Policies**: Subject to policy evaluation (spending limits, time restrictions, etc.)
   - **Critical Security Guarantee**: If NO signer with sufficient permissions is found for ANY context, the entire transaction fails

3. **Early Exit Optimization**
   - Authorization stops immediately when the first valid signer is found for each context
   - This prevents unnecessary computation while maintaining security guarantees

**Security Model Summary:**
- **Fail-Safe Default**: Deny all operations unless explicitly authorized
- **No Partial Success**: All contexts must be authorized or the entire transaction fails
- **Cryptographic Foundation**: All authorization decisions are based on verified signatures using Stellar battle-tested cryptographic primitives
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different signer types have different authorization capabilities

    <td>Spoofing</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Spoof.1</strong><br>
      <strong>S1R1</strong> - Enforce secure private key management on the client side, as this is a fundamental risk in any key-based system. To mitigate the impact of a key compromise, scope permissions to limit the potential attack surface. For example, a day-to-day key can be configured with spending limits, while high-value operations require a more secure, less frequently used key.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Spoof.2</strong><br>
      <strong>S2R1</strong> - Rely on the Soroban authorization framework, which cryptographically ties every authorization entry to a specific `invoker_contract_address`. This ensures that a signature intended for one contract cannot be used to authorize an invocation on another, preventing contract spoofing.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Spoof.3</strong><br>
      <strong>S3R1</strong> - Utilize Soroban's built-in nonce mechanism. Each signature payload must include a unique, randomly generated nonce that is consumed upon use. This makes it impossible to replay a valid signature in a different transaction and ensures each authorization is unique.

    <td>Tampering</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Tamper.1</strong><br>
      <strong>T1R1</strong> - Ensure that the contract re-calculates and verifies the signature payload hash against the provided signature in every `__check_auth` call. Since the payload itself is signed, any tampering will invalidate the signature, causing the authorization to fail.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Tamper.2</strong><br>
      <strong>T2R1</strong> - Implement strict access controls for all state-modifying operations. <br>1. Protect all functions that modify critical storage (e.g., signer configuration, policies) with admin-level authorization checks. <br>2. Derive storage keys for signers from their public keys to prevent accidental or malicious overwrites. <br>3. Use strictly defined data types for all stored objects to prevent injection attacks via serialization.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Tamper.3</strong><br>
      <strong>T3R1</strong> - Restrict all contract state modification functions, including those for signer permissions and policies, to admin signers. This prevents a standard or restricted signer from modifying their own roles or policies.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Tamper.4</strong><br>
      <strong>T4R1</strong> - Treat contract upgrades as a standard, high-privilege transaction that must be authorized by admin signers. Any tampering with the upgrade parameters (e.g., the Wasm hash) will invalidate the transaction's signature payload, causing the authorization to be rejected.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Tamper.5</strong><br>
      <strong>T5R1</strong> - Enforce the use of Soroban's nonce mechanism within the signature payload. The nonce must be validated and consumed upon use, preventing any manipulation or replay of the authorization.

    <td>Repudiation</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Repudiate.1</strong><br>
      <strong>R1R1</strong> - Leverage the inherent non-repudiation of public-key cryptography. By requiring a valid cryptographic signature for every transaction, we create a permanent and publicly verifiable on-chain record that proves a specific key authorized the action.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Repudiate.2</strong><br>
      <strong>R2R1</strong> - Enforce that all administrative operations are standard transactions that require a cryptographic signature from an admin. This creates a non-repudiable on-chain audit trail for all sensitive actions.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Repudiate.3</strong><br>
      <strong>R3R1</strong> - Store all authorization policies on-chain and ensure they can only be modified via admin-signed transactions. This provides a verifiable, timestamped history of policy configurations, making it impossible to repudiate actions by claiming a misunderstanding of permissions.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Repudiate.4</strong><br>
      <strong>R4R1</strong> - Require every authorizing party to provide a distinct signature within the transaction's authorization entry. When an operation requires multiple signers, this ensures that the participation of each party is explicitly and individually recorded on-chain, clarifying accountability.

  <tr>
    <td>Denial of Service</td>
    <td>
      <strong>DoS.1</strong><br>
      <strong>D1R1</strong> - Rely on the Stellar network's transaction pricing model to handle the computational costs of context verification. To prevent abuse, pre-validate that all signing keys in a transaction exist in the account's signer registry before performing costly signature verification. This ensures transactions with invalid signers fail early and cheaply.
      <br><br>
      <strong>DoS.2</strong><br>
      <strong>D2R1</strong> - Rely on Soroban's use of a large, random nonce space (2^64). This makes nonce exhaustion computationally infeasible for an attacker.
      <br><br>
      <strong>DoS.3</strong><br>
      <strong>D3R1</strong> - Restrict upgrade initiation to admin signers. Since an upgrade does not lock the contract from further state changes, a stalled or failed upgrade can be superseded by a new, valid upgrade transaction from an admin, preventing a lock state.

  <tr>
    <td>Elevation of Privilege</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Elevation.1</strong><br>
      <strong>E1R1</strong> - Implement and enforce a strict, hierarchical role-based access control (RBAC) model. Protect all administrative functions, including role modifications, with an `require_admin` check that ensures only admin signers can authorize them.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Elevation.2</strong><br>
      <strong>E2R1</strong> - Protect the `upgrade` function with the same `require_admin` check as other sensitive operations. This prevents standard or restricted signers from authorizing code changes.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Elevation.3</strong><br>
      <strong>E3R1</strong> - Restrict all signer management functions (add, update, remove) to admin signers. Ensure the logic prevents a signer from modifying their own permissions unless they are already an admin.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Elevation.4</strong><br>
      <strong>E4R1</strong> - Do not implement any special emergency or back-door recovery mechanisms that could bypass the standard authorization flow. All recovery scenarios must be handled through the existing admin-controlled signer management system.

      <strong>Elevation.5</strong><br>
      <strong>E5R1</strong> - Implement both the `SmartAccountInterface` and `CustomAccountInterface` on the same contract to share the same storage and authorization logic.

## Did we do a good job?

### Has the data flow diagram been referenced since it was created?

Definitely! It was quite useful for having a visual mental model of the authorization mechanism.

### Did the STRIDE model uncover any new design issues or concerns that had not been previously addressed or thought of?

Yes. We've realized the risk of leaving the contract in a vulnerable state after an upgrade if a required data migration is not performed correctly. This will be taken into account for future upgrades.

### Did the treatments identified in the "What are we going to do about it" section adequately address the issues identified?

Yes, and they will serve as the starting point for any further analysis.

### Have additional issues been found after the threat model?

Not yet.

### Any additional thoughts or insights on the threat modeling process that could help improve it next time?

No.
